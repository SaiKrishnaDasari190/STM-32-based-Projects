# STM32 DISCOVERY on Board LED's Blinking
This the basic project to blink the on board LED's of STM32F407VG Development Board (STM32 Discovery Board)

The Board comes with one user button, one reset button and four LEDs(i.e. Red, Blue, Orange, Green) 

Whenever the user presses the button the LEDs need to toggle

The LEDs are numbered from 0 to 3 (i.e 0,1,2,3 )

Accordingly we need to write the Code

__Documentation folder:__ Consits of a PDF which describes the block diagram, Description , and Flow chart for the Project

__Firmware folder:__ Consits of Program Code in Keil uVision using C programming Language

__Hardware folder:__ Consists of the Images/Videos/Circuit Diagrams of the Hardware of STM32 Outputs
